# Installing and activating Jetpack

1. In the WordPress Dashboard, click Plugins.
2. From the Plugins area, select Add New.
3. In the Add Plugins page, go to the Search Plugins field and enter Jetpack.
4. The Jetpack plugin will appear. Click Install Now. 
5. Click Activate Plugin. Note: At this point, Jetpack is active, but "locked." You'll need to unlock it using the Fannypack plugin or a WordPress.com account (see below.) 

## Fannypack

If you don't have an existing WordPress.com account, you can use Fannypack to run Jetpack in Developer Mode. Features like the Portfolio Custom Content Type, Photo Carrosel, and Extra Sidebar Widgets are enabled, but enhanced security features can't be turned on.
    
## WordPress.com

If you have an existing WordPress.com account, you can use it to unlock Jetpack. This will allow to use all of the Jetpack modules.
