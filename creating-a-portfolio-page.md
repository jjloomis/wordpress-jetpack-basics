# Creating a Portfolio Page

Instead of adding work samples directly to your Portfolio Page, you'll use shortcode to automaticaly bring your Portfolio Projects into this page. 

1. In the Dashboard, click Pages.
2. From the Pages submenu, select Add New.
3. Name the page `Portfolio Page`. Note: You can change the button label to `Portfolio` in the Menu area of your site. However, the slug for your Portfolio Page must be `portfolio-page`.
4. In the Visual or Text editor add the following shortcode \(be sure to include both brackets\):

      `[portfolio]`

4. When finished, click Publish or Update. By default the shortcode will display all of your Portfolio Projects in a two-column grid. You can customize your portfolio layout by adding attributes to your shortcode.
