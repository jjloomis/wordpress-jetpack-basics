This step is optional, but it is highly recommended. Creating Project Types will give you greater control over the layout of your Projects. As youâ€™ll see later, you can use Project Types with the [portfolio] shortcode that adds your Portfolio to your site.

1. In the Dashboard, click Portfolio.
2. From the Portfolio submenu, select Project Types.
3. In the Project Types page, give your Project Type a name and slug. (Note: A slug contains only lowercase letters or numbers. A slug does not contain spaces. Use a hyphen to separate words and/ or numbers. Slugs look-like-this.)
4. Scroll down and click Add New Project Type.
