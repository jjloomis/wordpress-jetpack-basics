# Creating Portfolio Project Types

This step is optional, but recommended if you want greater control over the layout of your Projects. You can use Project Types within the `[portfolio]` shortcode that adds your Portfolio to your site.

1. In the Dashboard, click Portfolio.
2. From the Portfolio submenu, select Project Types.
3. In the Project Types page, give your Project Type a name and slug. (Note: A slug contains only lowercase letters or numbers. A slug does not contain spaces. Use a hyphen to separate words and/ or numbers. Slugs look-like-this.)
4. Scroll down and click Add New Project Type.
